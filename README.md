ckanext-cdc_theme
=================

OpenData CKAN theme - TEST. This theme was based on OpenDataPhilly Theme (ckanext-odp_theme) but it has evolved beyond this.

This theme is for testing and learning purposes. It depends on several ckan extensions: ckanext-pages, ckanext-showcase, ckanext-rating,...

Manually generating main.css
----------------------------

Run `sass ckanext/cdc_theme/public/css/sass/main.scss ckanext/cdc_theme/public/css/main.css`

This will be done automatically when deploying via ansible.
